# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi, I'm **Oleg Łyżwiński**, a passionate developer and mechatronics engineer specializing in **computational applications** and **machine learning** within my field. I primarily work in **Python**, creating tools and solutions that bridge the gap between hardware and software. My projects often involve **data processing, analysis, and visualization**, as well as developing algorithms for practical engineering problems.

Outside of coding, I'm deeply interested in **military technology** and **strength sports**, which keep me both mentally and physically engaged. In the tech world, I’m fascinated by **data processing, analysis, and anything related to extracting insights from complex datasets**.

Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and contributions. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out to me!
